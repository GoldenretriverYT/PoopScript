# PoopScript
PoopScript is a simple, "shitty" script language that only has an interpreter written in JS lol

# How do I use PoopScript
To find out how to use PoopScript, please look at the documentation. To use the testing feature, you probably should clone the repository and open "test.html" - or you use the one hosted on GitHub Pages, which might not always be up-to-date.
