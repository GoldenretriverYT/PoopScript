# PoopScript
PoopScript is a simple, "shitty" script language that only has an interpreter written in JS lol

# How do I use PoopScript
To find out how to use PoopScript, please open the documentation folder. Since these docs were written in HTML, I will soon provide a website hosting the docs. Currently, the best way to view the docs like they are meant to look is to clone the repository and just open them locally.
